            <h1>Profile</h1>
            <div class="about">    
                <p> I graduated from the Turkish Military Academy in 2009 as an officer. While I was working as an officer, I decided to study at another university in order to improve myself in terms of knowledge. In 2014, I was entitled to enter the Faculty of Law of the European University of Lefke in Cyprus. When I was in my last year at the Faculty of Law, I had to drop out of school and leave the country due to the political events in my country..</p>
                <p>I have developed my critical decision-making and effective delivery skills in 
                multidisciplinary teams and fast-paced environments. I prioritize supporting the 
                development of my team while channeling my ambition for continuous learning and 
                self-development.</p>
